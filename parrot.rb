# Create method `parrot` that outputs a given phrase and
# returns the phrase

def parrot(phrase = "Squawk!")
  puts "#{phrase}"
  return "#{phrase}"
end

#In this lab, I have written a method called #parrot which accepts an argument of a string (phrase = "Squawk!"). This method puts out the string #{phrase} as seen in the logic using the puts and return operators and returns the string before the method ends. The default argument is the string "Squawk!".
